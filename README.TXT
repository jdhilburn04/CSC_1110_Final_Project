1. This projects creates a game console class, a game class and an app class that 
   creates a text based adventure game in the terminal. You can navigate across 
   rooms by typing in directions in the terminal
2. The program accepts strings but the only commands it accepts are help, and go (direction)
3. Each command prompts a response
4. There are five rooms

This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version,
it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.
That's all.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

This version of the game contains some very bad class design. It should NOT
be used as a basis for extending the project without fixing these design
problems. It serves as an example to discuss good and bad design (chapter 8
of the book).

Chapter 8 of the book contains a detailed description of the problems in this
project, and how to fix them.

The project 'zuul-better' contains a version of this project with better
designed class structure. It includes the fixes discussed in the book.
